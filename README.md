## MVP
Goal of this project is to help people find missing pets. The main users of this app are people who have pets and actively use mobile apps.

After researching the market in this area, no mobile pet finder apps were found. There are only kennel websites, but this is not actually the same as our app.

### Project strengths
The strengths of the project are mobility compared to competitors in our country. It is also a common base for all people who have pets. Anyone can see, update or add information about a lost pet.

### Disadvantages of the project
The disadvantages of the project are its focus on a limited range of users. The first is people who have pets and can lose them. Also, these are people who actively use mobile applications.

### Threats of the project
The threat of the project may be that the application will not be in demand for an indefinite period of time. Animals are not lost that often, so the app may not be active among users. Also, in today&#39;s world, animals are increasingly chipped and can be found without the help of other people.
